name: Lennard Jones
description: |
    Compute the Lennard Jones Pontential for a random cluster of atoms
    in 3D space of a fixed radius.  This computes sum of all energy potentials
    of every pair of atoms in the cluster.

    - name: numpy
      description: Numpy function
      function: numpy_impl.py:potential_numpy
    - name: numba_array
      description: Numba function operating on mostly array.
                   This is not a fast implementation but is the closest to
                   the *numpy* version.
      function: numba_array_impl.py:potential_numba_array
    - name: numba_scalar
      description: Numba function operating on scalar mostly.
                   This version has the algorithm rewritten to operate on
                   a scalar at a time in manually written loops.
      function: numba_scalar_impl.py:potential_numba_scalar
    - name: numba_scalar_prange
      description: This enables the *prange* feature on *numba_scalar*.
